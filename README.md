# To-Do-list

A To-Do List is a simple yet powerful tool for organizing tasks and managing time effectively. 
It serves as a digital or physical list where users can jot down tasks they need to complete, prioritize them, and mark them as done once finished. 
To-Do Lists help individuals stay focused, reduce stress, and increase productivity by providing a clear overview of tasks at hand.
Whether used for personal or professional purposes, a To-Do List is an indispensable tool for anyone looking to streamline their workflow and accomplish goals efficiently.
